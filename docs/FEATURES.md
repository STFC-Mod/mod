# STFC Community Mod Features

The STFC Community Mod adds configurable quality-of-life improvements to the desktop version of Star Trek Fleet Command. This catalog describes the user-facing features represented by the current source code and English example configuration.

Most options are configured in `community_patch_settings.toml`. The mod creates a default settings file when one is missing and also writes a parsed settings file so you can see the values that were applied. Nearly every shortcut can be remapped; see [`KEYMAPPING.md`](docs/KEYMAPPING.md) for valid key names.

## Display and window controls

- Set the overall interface scale and the amount changed by each scale adjustment.
- Scale object viewers independently from the main interface.
- Scale ship models in System View independently from the interface.
- Adjust the interface, viewer, and ship scales while playing with configurable shortcuts.
- Enable freely resizable game windows on Windows.
- Enable borderless fullscreen mode and switch between fullscreen and windowed mode without restarting the game.

## Reliability and configuration support

- Enable or disable patch groups independently in development builds.
- Log mod initialization, patch installation, and optional sync or audio diagnostics for troubleshooting.

## Platform and availability notes

- Windows and macOS do not necessarily expose every feature in exactly the same way.
- Free window resizing and extended tagged chest-purchase sliders are Windows-specific.
- The instant cargo counter is guarded for a supported Windows client build; unsupported builds retain the native animation.
- Some settings are experimental or diagnostic and may be disabled, client-version-specific, or intended for troubleshooting.
- Patch availability can change when the game client changes because the mod hooks the native IL2CPP runtime.
